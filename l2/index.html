    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>

<div class="text"> 
    <p>Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, you need a power <b>that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b>        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. </p>
    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing
        something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <p>In an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass
        Robin". Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the Teen Titans, and he's trained with everybody
        in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; He's a lot looser and more relaxed."</p>
